# QA Checklist for GraphFlow

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for manually testing the GraphFlow application. It covers all major features and functionality to ensure the application works as expected.

## Frontend Testing

### General UI

- [ ] Verify that the application loads without errors
- [ ] Check that all pages are responsive and display correctly on different screen sizes
- [ ] Ensure that navigation between pages works correctly
- [ ] Verify that all buttons, links, and interactive elements are clickable and functional
- [ ] Check that error messages are displayed appropriately when errors occur

### Graph Editor

- [ ] Verify that the ReactFlow canvas loads correctly
- [ ] Check that nodes can be added to the canvas by clicking the appropriate buttons
- [ ] Ensure that nodes can be dragged and positioned on the canvas
- [ ] Verify that edges can be created between nodes
- [ ] Check that nodes and edges can be selected and deleted
- [ ] Ensure that node properties can be edited via the properties panel
- [ ] Verify that the graph can be zoomed in/out and panned
- [ ] Check that the graph state is preserved when navigating away and back to the editor

### Agent Configuration

- [ ] Verify that different agent types can be selected from the UI
- [ ] Check that agent-specific properties can be configured
- [ ] Ensure that agent configurations are saved correctly
- [ ] Verify that agent configurations can be loaded and edited

### Graph Management

- [ ] Verify that graphs can be saved with a name and description
- [ ] Check that saved graphs appear in the list of graphs
- [ ] Ensure that graphs can be loaded from the list
- [ ] Verify that graphs can be updated after editing
- [ ] Check that graphs can be deleted
- [ ] Ensure that graph metadata (creation date, last modified, etc.) is displayed correctly

### Graph Execution

- [ ] Verify that graphs can be executed by clicking the "Run" button
- [ ] Check that input parameters can be provided for graph execution
- [ ] Ensure that execution progress is displayed to the user
- [ ] Verify that execution results are displayed correctly
- [ ] Check that execution logs are available for debugging
- [ ] Ensure that execution can be stopped if it's taking too long

## Backend Testing

### API Endpoints

- [ ] Verify that all API endpoints return the expected responses
- [ ] Check that API endpoints handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Ensure that API endpoints validate input data correctly
- [ ] Verify that API endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Database Integration

- [ ] Verify that graphs are saved to the database correctly
- [ ] Check that graphs can be retrieved from the database
- [ ] Ensure that graph updates are persisted to the database
- [ ] Verify that graph deletions remove the data from the database

### LangGraph Integration

- [ ] Verify that LangGraph graphs are built correctly from the graph definitions
- [ ] Check that different node types (LLM, tool, transform, etc.) work as expected
- [ ] Ensure that conditional edges route correctly based on the conditions
- [ ] Verify that graph execution produces the expected results
- [ ] Check that LangGraph errors are handled gracefully and reported to the user

## Security Testing

- [ ] Verify that API endpoints are protected against unauthorized access
- [ ] Check that user data is properly isolated (if multi-user support is enabled)
- [ ] Ensure that sensitive data (API keys, etc.) is not exposed to the client
- [ ] Verify that input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Check that error messages don't reveal sensitive information

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Verify that the application loads quickly
- [ ] Check that graph operations (add/delete nodes, create edges, etc.) are responsive
- [ ] Ensure that saving and loading graphs is fast, even for large graphs
- [ ] Verify that graph execution doesn't block the UI
- [ ] Check that the application remains responsive when multiple users are active (if applicable)

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify that the application handles very large graphs
- [ ] Check that the application handles graphs with cycles
- [ ] Ensure that the application handles graphs with invalid configurations
- [ ] Verify that the application handles network interruptions gracefully
- [ ] Check that the application recovers from server errors

## Regression Testing

- [ ] Verify that all previously reported bugs remain fixed
- [ ] Check that new features don't break existing functionality
- [ ] Ensure that the application works with the latest versions of dependencies
- [ ] Verify that the application works in all supported browsers
- [ ] Check that the application works on all supported platforms

## Documentation

- [ ] Verify that the documentation accurately describes the application
- [ ] Check that the documentation includes all features and functionality
- [ ] Ensure that the documentation provides clear instructions for users
- [ ] Verify that the API documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Check that the documentation is up-to-date with the latest version of the application

## How to Use This Checklist

1. Copy this checklist for each testing session
2. Check off items as they are tested and pass
3. For items that fail, create detailed bug reports including:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots or videos if applicable
   - Environment details (browser, OS, etc.)
4. Prioritize fixing critical issues before releasing
5. Re-test fixed issues to ensure they are resolved

Remember that this checklist is a living document and should be updated as the application evolves and new features are added.
