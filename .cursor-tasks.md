### Prompt for the AI Agent

You are to build a web application that provides a visual, drag-and-drop interface (using ReactFlow) to construct and manage agent workflows powered by [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). The frontend uses Next.js (with Tailwind CSS), and the backend is written in FastAPI with a Postgres database. The application must allow users to:

1. **Visually configure** various **LangGraph**based agent architectures in a graph-like UI.
2. **Select** or **create** agent “types” (LLM-based, knowledge-base, multi-tool, etc.) by choosing from UI options.
3. **Store** the final agent graphs and relevant conversation or memory data in Postgres.
4. **Deploy** or run these agent graphs, exposing a simple endpoint to trigger or query results from the agent.

`## [START LangGraph_Archutecture Code From DOcumentation]` 

## Below given are the some arhchiectures that I would initially want to my app to atleast handle althrough it should do regardless of these since UI based based omponenets can create any langgraph based app.

<First Architecture>

### Plan-and-Execute[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#plan-and-execute)

This notebook shows how to create a "plan-and-execute" style agent. This is heavily inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) paper as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.

The core idea is to first come up with a multi-step plan, and then go through that plan one item at a time. After accomplishing a particular task, you can then revisit the plan and modify as appropriate.

The general computational graph looks like the following:


This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent where you think one step at a time. The advantages of this "plan-and-execute" style agent are:

1. Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)
2. Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using larger/better models for the planning step

The following walkthrough demonstrates how to do so in LangGraph. The resulting agent will leave a trace like the following example: ([link](https://smith.langchain.com/public/d46e24d3-dda6-44d5-9550-b618fca4e0d4/r)).

## Setup[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#setup)

First, we need to install the packages required.

`%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain-community langchain-openai tavily-python`

Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use) and Tavily (the search tool we will use)

`import getpass
import os
def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")`

**Set up [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for LangGraph development**

Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started [here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).

## Define Tools[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#define-tools)

We will first define the tools we want to use. For this simple example, we will use a built-in search tool via Tavily. However, it is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/custom_tools) on how to do that.

`from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=3)]`

API Reference: [TavilySearchResults](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/tools/langchain_community.tools.tavily_search.tool.TavilySearchResults.html)

## Define our Execution Agent[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#define-our-execution-agent)

Now we will create the execution agent we want to use to execute tasks. Note that for this example, we will be using the same execution agent for each task, but this doesn't HAVE to be the case.

`from langchain import hub
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
# Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview")
prompt = "You are a helpful assistant."
agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt=prompt)`

API Reference: [ChatOpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/chat_models/langchain_openai.chat_models.base.ChatOpenAI.html) | [create_react_agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent)

## Define the State[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#define-the-state)

Let's now start by defining the state the track for this agent.

First, we will need to track the current plan. Let's represent that as a list of strings.

Next, we should track previously executed steps. Let's represent that as a list of tuples (these tuples will contain the step and then the result)

Finally, we need to have some state to represent the final response as well as the original input.

`import operator
from typing import Annotated, List, Tuple
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
class PlanExecute(TypedDict):
    input: str
    plan: List[str]
    past_steps: Annotated[List[Tuple], operator.add]
    response: str`

## Planning Step[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#planning-step)

Let's now think about creating the planning step. This will use function calling to create a plan.

**Using Pydantic with LangChain**

This notebook uses Pydantic v2 `BaseModel`, which requires `langchain-core >= 0.3`. Using `langchain-core < 0.3` will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 `BaseModels`.

`from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
class Plan(BaseModel):
    """Plan to follow in future"""
    steps: List[str] = Field(
        description="different steps to follow, should be in sorted order"
    )`

`from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
planner_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            """For the given objective, come up with a simple step by step plan. \
This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps. \
The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.""",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
    ]
)
planner = planner_prompt | ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4o", temperature=0
).with_structured_output(Plan)`

API Reference: [ChatPromptTemplate](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.chat.ChatPromptTemplate.html)

`planner.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [
            ("user", "what is the hometown of the current Australia open winner?")
        ]
    }
)`

`Plan(steps=['Identify the current winner of the Australia Open.', 'Find the hometown of the identified winner.'])`

## Re-Plan Step[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#re-plan-step)

Now, let's create a step that re-does the plan based on the result of the previous step.

`from typing import Union
class Response(BaseModel):
    """Response to user."""
    response: str
class Act(BaseModel):
    """Action to perform."""
    action: Union[Response, Plan] = Field(
        description="Action to perform. If you want to respond to user, use Response. "
        "If you need to further use tools to get the answer, use Plan."
    )
replanner_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    """For the given objective, come up with a simple step by step plan. \
This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps. \
The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.
Your objective was this:
{input}
Your original plan was this:
{plan}
You have currently done the follow steps:
{past_steps}
Update your plan accordingly. If no more steps are needed and you can return to the user, then respond with that. Otherwise, fill out the plan. Only add steps to the plan that still NEED to be done. Do not return previously done steps as part of the plan."""
)
replanner = replanner_prompt | ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4o", temperature=0
).with_structured_output(Act)`

## Create the Graph[¶](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#create-the-graph)

We can now create the graph!

`from typing import Literal
from langgraph.graph import END

    plan = state["plan"]
    plan_str = "\n".join(f"{i+1}. {step}" for i, step in enumerate(plan))

    task_formatted = f"""For the following plan:

    agent_response = await agent_executor.ainvoke(
        {"messages": [("user", task_formatted)]}
    )
    return {
        "past_steps": [(task, agent_response["messages"][-1].content)],
    }
async def plan_step(state: PlanExecute):
    plan = await planner.ainvoke({"messages": [("user", state["input"])]})
    return {"plan": plan.steps}
async def replan_step(state: PlanExecute):
    output = await replanner.ainvoke(state)
    if isinstance(output.action, Response):
        return {"response": output.action.response}
    else:
        return {"plan": output.action.steps}
def should_end(state: PlanExecute):
    if "response" in state and state["response"]:
        return END
    else:
        return "agent"`

## <Second Architecture>

Reasoning without Observation¶
In ReWOO, Xu, et. al, propose an agent that combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use. It was designed to improve on the ReACT-style agent architecture in the following ways:

Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of tools used in a single pass. (ReACT-style agent architecture requires many LLM calls with redundant prefixes (since the system prompt and previous steps are provided to the LLM for each reasoning step)
Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning data doesn't depend on the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually invoking the tools (in theory).
The following diagram outlines ReWOO's overall computation graph:

ReWoo Diagram

ReWOO is made of 3 modules:

🧠Planner: Generate the plan in the following format:

Plan: <reasoning>
#E1 = Tool[argument for tool]
Plan: <reasoning>
#E2 = Tool[argument for tool with #E1 variable substitution]
...
Worker: executes the tool with the provided arguments.
🧠Solver: generates the answer for the initial task based on the tool observations.
The modules with a 🧠 emoji depend on an LLM call. Notice that we avoid redundant calls to the planner LLM by using variable substitution.

In this example, each module is represented by a LangGraph node. The end result will leave a trace that looks like this one. Let's get started!

Setup¶
For this example, we will provide the agent with a Tavily search engine tool. You can get an API key here or replace with a free tool option (e.g., duck duck go search).

Let's install the required packages and set our API keys


%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_community langchain_openai tavily-python

import getpass
import os


def _set_if_undefined(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}=")


_set_if_undefined("TAVILY_API_KEY")
_set_if_undefined("OPENAI_API_KEY")
Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here.

Define graph state¶
In LangGraph, every node updates a shared graph state. The state is the input to any node whenever it is invoked.

Below, we will define a state dict to contain the task, plan, steps, and other variables.


from typing import List
from typing_extensions import TypedDict


class ReWOO(TypedDict):
    task: str
    plan_string: str
    steps: List
    results: dict
    result: str
Planner¶
The planner prompts an LLM to generate a plan in the form of a task list. The arguments to each task are strings that may contain special variables (#E{0-9}+) that are used for variable substitution from other task results.

ReWOO workflow

Our example agent will have two tools: 1. Google - a search engine (in this case Tavily) 2. LLM - an LLM call to reason about previous outputs.

The LLM tool receives less of the prompt context and so can be more token-efficient than the ReACT paradigm.


from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
API Reference: ChatOpenAI


prompt = """For the following task, make plans that can solve the problem step by step. For each plan, indicate \
which external tool together with tool input to retrieve evidence. You can store the evidence into a \
variable #E that can be called by later tools. (Plan, #E1, Plan, #E2, Plan, ...)

Tools can be one of the following:
(1) Google[input]: Worker that searches results from Google. Useful when you need to find short
and succinct answers about a specific topic. The input should be a search query.
(2) LLM[input]: A pretrained LLM like yourself. Useful when you need to act with general
world knowledge and common sense. Prioritize it when you are confident in solving the problem
yourself. Input can be any instruction.

For example,
Task: Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week. Thomas worked x
hours. Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours
less than Toby. How many hours did Rebecca work?
Plan: Given Thomas worked x hours, translate the problem into algebraic expressions and solve
with Wolfram Alpha. #E1 = WolframAlpha[Solve x + (2x − 10) + ((2x − 10) − 8) = 157]
Plan: Find out the number of hours Thomas worked. #E2 = LLM[What is x, given #E1]
Plan: Calculate the number of hours Rebecca worked. #E3 = Calculator[(2 ∗ #E2 − 10) − 8]

Begin! 
Describe your plans with rich details. Each Plan should be followed by only one #E.

Task: {task}"""

task = "what is the exact hometown of the 2024 mens australian open winner"

result = model.invoke(prompt.format(task=task))

print(result.content)

Plan: Use Google to search for the 2024 Australian Open winner.
#E1 = Google[2024 Australian Open winner]

Plan: Retrieve the name of the 2024 Australian Open winner from the search results.
#E2 = LLM[What is the name of the 2024 Australian Open winner, given #E1]

Plan: Use Google to search for the hometown of the 2024 Australian Open winner.
#E3 = Google[hometown of 2024 Australian Open winner, given #E2]

Plan: Retrieve the hometown of the 2024 Australian Open winner from the search results.
#E4 = LLM[What is the hometown of the 2024 Australian Open winner, given #E3]
Planner Node¶
To connect the planner to our graph, we will create a get_plan node that accepts the ReWOO state and returns with a state update for the steps and plan_string fields.


import re

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Regex to match expressions of the form E#... = ...[...]
regex_pattern = r"Plan:\s*(.+)\s*(#E\d+)\s*=\s*(\w+)\s*\[([^\]]+)\]"
prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("user", prompt)])
planner = prompt_template | model


def get_plan(state: ReWOO):
    task = state["task"]
    result = planner.invoke({"task": task})
    # Find all matches in the sample text
    matches = re.findall(regex_pattern, result.content)
    return {"steps": matches, "plan_string": result.content}
API Reference: ChatPromptTemplate

Executor¶
The executor receives the plan and executes the tools in sequence.

Below, instantiate the search engine and define the tool execution node.


from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

search = TavilySearchResults()
API Reference: TavilySearchResults


def _get_current_task(state: ReWOO):
    if "results" not in state or state["results"] is None:
        return 1
    if len(state["results"]) == len(state["steps"]):
        return None
    else:
        return len(state["results"]) + 1


def tool_execution(state: ReWOO):
    """Worker node that executes the tools of a given plan."""
    _step = _get_current_task(state)
    _, step_name, tool, tool_input = state["steps"][_step - 1]

<Third Architecture>

Reflexion¶
Reflexion by Shinn, et. al., is an architecture designed to learn through verbal feedback and self-reflection. The agent explicitly critiques its responses for tasks to generate a higher quality final response, at the expense of longer execution time.

reflexion diagram

The paper outlines 3 main components:

Actor (agent) with self-reflection
External evaluator (task-specific, e.g. code compilation steps)
Episodic memory that stores the reflections from (1).
In their code, the last two components are very task-specific, so in this notebook, you will build the actor in LangGraph.

To skip to the graph definition, see the Construct Graph section below.

Setup¶
Install langgraph (for the framework), langchain_openai (for the LLM), and langchain + tavily-python (for the search engine).

We will use tavily search as a tool. You can get an API key here or replace with a different tool of your choosing.


%pip install -U --quiet langgraph langchain_anthropic tavily-python

import getpass
import os


def _set_if_undefined(var: str) -> None:
    if os.environ.get(var):
        return
    os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(var)


_set_if_undefined("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_if_undefined("TAVILY_API_KEY")
Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here.

Define our LLM¶

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
# You could also use OpenAI or another provider
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview")
API Reference: ChatAnthropic

Actor (with reflection)¶
The main component of Reflexion is the "actor", which is an agent that reflects on its response and re-executes to improve based on self-critique. It's main sub-components include: 1. Tools/tool execution 2. Initial responder: generate an initial response (and self-reflection) 3. Revisor: re-respond (and reflec) based on previous reflections

We'll first define the tool execution context.

Construct tools¶

from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_community.utilities.tavily_search import TavilySearchAPIWrapper

search = TavilySearchAPIWrapper()
tavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(api_wrapper=search, max_results=5)
API Reference: TavilySearchResults | TavilySearchAPIWrapper

Initial responder¶
Using Pydantic with LangChain

This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.

Create Tool Node¶
Next, create a node to execute the tool calls. While we give the LLMs different schema names (and use those for validation), we want them both to route to the same tool.

    answer: The climate crisis poses an existential threat that requires urgent, far-reaching action on a global scale. To tackle this enormous challenge, a multi-pronged approach leveraging policy changes, technological innovations, and shifts in human behavior is needed.

On the policy front, governments should implement carbon pricing mechanisms like cap-and-trade systems or carbon taxes to disincentivize emissions and drive investment into clean energy sources. Strict regulations on polluting industries as well as subsidies and tax credits for renewable energy development can also accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. International cooperation through treaties and knowledge sharing will be vital.

Technological advances in areas like energy storage, carbon capture, sustainable aviation fuels, and green hydrogen production will be key enablers. Substantial investment into research and commercialization of such innovations is critical.

Personal lifestyle changes like reducing energy consumption, eating more plant-based foods, taking fewer flights, and shifting to electric vehicles can also make a meaningful dent. However, systemic change at the industrial level driven by smart policymaking and continued technological breakthroughs will ultimately determine our ability to avoid the most catastrophic climate impacts.

One recent study by the Rhodium Group found that even if the Biden administration implemented a sweeping package of climate measures \u2014 including hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy spending that remains stalled in Congress \u2014 and individual states adopted tougher rules of their own, the United States would barely stay on track to meet its target.\n In 2014, before the Paris climate agreement, the world was on track to heat up nearly 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, an outcome widely seen as catastrophic.\n In response, a growing number of world leaders, including President Biden, have said that the world should hold to 1.5 degrees of warming, although some countries like China and India have not embraced the stricter goal.\n In recent years, more than 50 countries plus the European Union have formally vowed to get to \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions, which is essentially a promise to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere altogether by a certain date."}, {"url": "https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2023/09/19/climate-policies-with-real-world-results", "content": "\u201cThey provide invaluable insights on how countries actually design and implement climate policies, and on the hard compromises that doing so can require, such as the rapid expansion of solar power in India, the use of waste to generate affordable energy in Mexico, and the greening of Colombia\u2019s construction industry.\u201d\n The plan also expects for the modal share for bikes to grow from 0.9 percent in 2019 to 11.6 percent by 2050 and estimates that the project could reduce emissions in Lima by 0.64 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) by 2030 and 1.03 tCO2e by 2050. Eight years after the 2015 Paris Agreement set ambitious, achievable goals to curb emissions and adapt to global climatic shifts, the world is still on track for unprecedented climate change -- and bureaucratic, political, and financial hurdles have stymied thousands of climate-friendly policies around the world.\n How real-world policies can lead to a low-carbon future\nWebsite:\u00a0Climate Stories: How Countries and Communities Are Shaping A Sustainable Future\nWebsite: World Bank - Climate Change\nBlogs\nWHAT'S NEW\nThis site uses cookies to optimize functionality and give you the best possible experience.

    answer: The climate crisis demands an all-hands-on-deck approach spanning policy measures, technological innovation, behavior changes, and natural climate solutions. On policy, implementing carbon pricing, emissions regulations, renewable energy incentives, and international agreements will be critical. Technological breakthroughs in clean energy storage, carbon capture, sustainable fuels, and green hydrogen also have a major role to play. 

However, vested interests, political gridlock, and the challenge of transitioning fossil fuel-based economies pose formidable hurdles that cannot be underestimated. Developing countries will need financing support and technology transfers to participate fully in mitigation efforts.

In parallel, conserving and restoring forests, wetlands, and other carbon sinks through nature-based solutions could contribute up to 30% of the emissions reductions required by 2050 [1]. Individual lifestyle adjustments like reducing energy use, eating more plant-based diets, and favoring public transit will also be impactful.

Ultimately, only a holistic strategy across all these fronts provides hope of averting the most catastrophic climate change scenarios. The costs of inaction would be civilization-threatening [2].

    answer: Tackling the climate crisis demands a multi-pronged global effort targeting policy reforms, technological innovation, behavior changes, and nature-based solutions. Key policy measures include carbon pricing, emissions regulations, clean energy incentives, and international climate agreements. Major technological breakthroughs are needed in clean energy storage, carbon capture, sustainable fuels, hydrogen and more.

However, formidable challenges persist - entrenched fossil fuel interests resisting change, political gridlock, difficulties transitioning carbon-intensive economies, international free-rider problems, and financing needs for developing countries. Developing nations will require substantial support to participate fully in mitigation efforts.

Nature-based solutions like forest conservation, reforestation and coastal restoration could provide up to 30% of needed emissions reductions by 2050 [1]. They offer significant co-benefits for biodiversity and communities. Individual actions to reduce energy use, favor plant-based diets, drive electric vehicles etc. can also move the needle.

Ultimately, dramatically bending the emissions curve requires a holistic global strategy coordinating all these elements. The costs of inaction risk civilization-threatening impacts from accelerating climate change [2]. Time is of the essence to alter our current trajectory.

    answer: The climate crisis is an existential threat requiring a coordinated global response across multiple fronts - policy, technology, shifts in human behavior, and nature-based solutions. 

Key policy levers include economy-wide carbon pricing, regulations to drive emissions reductions, incentives for renewable energy and clean tech R&D, and international agreements. Major technological breakthroughs are needed in areas like energy storage, carbon capture, sustainable aviation/shipping fuels, hydrogen, industrial decarbonization, and advanced nuclear.

However, the transition away from fossil fuels faces massive political and economic hurdles - entrenched industry interests, gridlock over sweeping policy changes, challenges in retooling carbon-intensive economies, global governance problems, and financing needs for developing countries. Those nations will require substantial financing support and tech transfers to participate fully in mitigation.

Nature-based solutions like forest protection, reforestation, and coastal restoration could provide up to 30% of needed emissions cuts by 2050 [1]. They offer co-benefits for communities and biodiversity. Complementary adaptation measures like resilient infrastructure, early warning systems, and climate-smart agriculture are also vital.

Ultimately, overcoming the crisis demands an unprecedented global cooperative effort coordinating robust policy frameworks, disruptive technological innovation, large-scale land use changes, climate financing mechanisms, and transformational individual choices. The costs of inaction - rising seas, famines, mass migration, ecosystem collapse - would be catastrophic and civilization-threatening [2]. We must rise to meet this generational challenge through sustained, aggressive action on all fronts.

**Primary technologies to use**:

- **Next.js** + **Tailwind CSS** for the front-end.
- **ReactFlow** for the graph-building UI interface.
- **FastAPI** for the back-end service that processes user requests.
- **LangGraph** for creating agentic AI pipelines (i.e., multi-step LLM-based flows).
- **Postgres** for persistent storage (e.g., storing user data, graph definitions, etc.).

The final application must:

- Have a Next.js front-end with ReactFlow components to allow drag-and-drop node creation, labeling, edge connections, etc.
- Allow users to choose or define agent “types” or subgraphs in the UI, which correspond to **LangGraph** definitions on the backend.
- Provide a minimal user authentication or session handling (if needed) so different user graphs remain separate.
- Persist all user-defined or selected agent graphs to Postgres.
- Expose a FastAPI endpoint that can **run** or **invoke** the user’s selected or built graph.
- Handle streaming or console-style logs if possible (optional but recommended).
- Integrate Tailwind for styling the Next.js frontend UI.

    ```
    
- [ ]  **Task 9.4:** Provide a function `build_langgraph_from_definition(definition: dict) -> StateGraph` that:
    1. Parses the incoming graph definition.

**Note**: Throughout your implementation, make sure to incorporate the **LangGraph** references **inside** the placeholders you defined. For example:

This ensures the advanced AI agent (or developers) know exactly where to insert or modify the **LangGraph** code.

By following the above tasks and user stories in sequence, you will create a fully functioning, visually oriented, agentic AI application using Next.js + Tailwind, ReactFlow, FastAPI, LangGraph, and Postgres. Be absolutely thorough in each step to ensure a smooth development and deployment experience.
